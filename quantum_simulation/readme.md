# Quantum Simulation using Finite Difference Method

The simulation is carried out by using the FD algorithm applied
to the Schroedinger equation.  The program is intended to act as
a demonstration of the FD algorithm and can be used as an educational
aid for quantum mechanics and numerical methods.  The simulation
parameters are defined in the code constants and can be freely
manipulated to see different behaviors.

The code has three built-in potential functions for demonstration.

1. Potential Well / Particle in a Box  
2. 1D arbitary potential  
3. 1D symetric potential  
4. 3D spherically symmetric
